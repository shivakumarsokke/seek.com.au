SeekSeleniumAutomation


Well, this is my first repository in creating automation test suite using selenium 2 and TestNG.

For the ease of kickoff, I have selected seek.com.au website to automate. 

Few test cases in mind to automate and then improvise
1. Open seek.com.au web page and validate the home page
2. Validate register new user flow
3. Login with existing user and access aplication
